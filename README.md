**Your Music Album Downloader**

Downloads albums from YouTube Music. Yeah, we know. Another downloader script. How original. But this one actually works without making you want to throw your laptop out the window.

<img src="https://github.com/youmad-app/youmad-shell/blob/main/youmad-neon-dark.png" width="500">

## Why YouMAD? Exists

Because you're tired of:
- Spotify removing your favorite albums without warning
- YouTube Music's terrible offline functionality  
- Being told what you can and can't do with music
- Complicated scripts that break every other week
- Plex having a complete meltdown because your metadata isn't perfect

## What It Does

Downloads entire albums from YouTube Music with one command. That's it. No PhD in computer science required.

```bash
./youmad.sh
```

Congratulations, you just learned the entire interface.

## Installation (For Humans)

**Stop panicking.** It's easier than setting up your printer.

**Dependencies** (install these first, genius):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (because of course you use Ubuntu)
sudo apt install ffmpeg exiftool jq opustags
pip install yt-dlp --user

# macOS (fancy, aren't we?)
brew install ffmpeg exiftool jq yt-dlp
```

**Get YouMAD?:**
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/youmad-app/youmad-shell/raw/main/youmad.sh
chmod +x youmad.sh
```

Done. See? We told you it was easy.

## How To Use (Rocket Science Not Required)

### Step 1: Add Your URLs
Create a file called `urls.txt` in the same folder as you run the script from:

```
https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_example;Artist Name
https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_example;Artist Name;
https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_example;Artist Name;ep
https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_example;Artist Name;live
```

Format: `URL;Artist Name;Release Type`

**Artist Name** (Because YouTube Music doesn't understand that an album is made by _someone_):
- This sets album artist to what you want, no more split albums in Plex
- This will also be the folder name where the albums are downloaded
- Use any character, including whitespace, except semicolon (because that's the separator, doh!)

**Release Types** (because Plex is picky):
- `album` - Regular albums (default, obviously)
- `ep` - EPs (not albums, apparently)  
- `single` - Singles (one song, much wow)
- `live` - Live albums (for when studio wasn't good enough)
- `comp` - Compilations (greatest hits, etc.)

This one is optional, Leave it out for the default (album). End with just the `;` for an empty `RELEASETYPE` tag.

**Only the URL** (because life's short):   
- If you enter just the URL, and nothing more, the Album Artist will be set to `Unknown Artist`. Are you really that lazy?

### Step 2: Run The Thing
```bash
./youmad.sh
```

**First time?**
It'll ask you some questions on audio format, rate-limiting, and browser cookies. Answer them. It's not a quiz.

```bash
./youmad.sh
=== YouMAD? Configuration ===
Leave blank to use defaults shown in brackets.

Preferred audio format (m4a, mp3, opus, flac, wav) [m4a]: m4a
Maximum download rate (e.g., 4M, 1M, 500K) [4M]:
Browser to extract cookies from (chrome, chromium, brave, firefox, safari, edge) [chrome]: chromium
```

### Step 3: Wait
Go make coffee. Browse Reddit. Question your life choices. The script is working.

### Step 4: Enjoy Your Music
Files appear in neat folders like: `Artist_Name/Album_Title/01 - Song.m4a`

Because unlike some people, we believe in organization.

## Command Options (For Show-Offs)

```bash
./youmad.sh --help          # Read the manual (shocking concept)
./youmad.sh --dry-run       # Pretend to download (commitment issues?)
./youmad.sh --verbose       # See ALL the technical gibberish
./youmad.sh --config        # Change your mind about settings
./youmad.sh --override      # Download everything again (wasteful)
./youmad.sh --playlist      # Simple playlist mode (skip the fancy stuff)
./youmad.sh --preserve      # Keep original format, ignores format in the config-file (audiophile mode)
```

### Advanced Options

**Playlist Mode (`--playlist`)**
- Downloads playlists directly without individual track processing
- Great for downloading your own curated playlists
- Simple folder structure: `Artist/Playlist-name/Track.ext`
- Preserves original track names from YouTube
- No metadata processing or track renumbering
- Perfect for when you just want the music, not the perfectionism

**Preserve Format (`--preserve`)**
- Keeps original audio format from YouTube (usually WebM)
- No re-encoding = maximum quality preservation
- Still organizes files and adds metadata
- Great for audiophiles who want zero quality loss
- Files might be in various formats (WebM, M4A, etc.)

**Pro Tips:**
- Use `--playlist --preserve` together for maximum speed and quality
- Use `--preserve --override` to re-download in original format
- Combine with `--verbose` to see what's actually happening

## What You Get

‚úÖ **High-quality audio** - Not potato quality like some tools  
‚úÖ **Proper metadata** - Album art, track numbers, cleaned up and Plex-ready  
‚úÖ **Organized files** - Sorted like a normal human being would  
‚úÖ **Format flexibility** - Convert to your preferred format or keep originals  
‚úÖ **No duplicates** - Because we're not savages  
‚úÖ **Clean filenames** - No weird Unicode disasters  
‚úÖ **Cross-platform** - Works on your Linux, Mac, or Windows-with-WSL setup  

## What Could Go Wrong

‚ö†Ô∏è **YouTube changes stuff** - Not our fault when Google breaks things  
‚ö†Ô∏è **You need cookies** - From your browser, not the edible kind  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Downloads take time** - We're being polite, unlike you  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Large files** - Music takes space, revolutionary concept  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Copyright laws exist** - Don't be stupid about this  

## FAQ (Frequently Avoided Questions)

**Q: Why is it called YouMAD?**  
A: Because that's the one question that pops up when adding media to Plex.  
And, it's short for "*Your Music Album Downloader*". Catchy, ey?

**Q: Can it download video?**  
A: No. It's a MUSIC downloader. Reading is fundamental.

**Q: What's the difference between normal mode and playlist mode?**  
A: Normal mode processes each track individually with proper metadata. Playlist mode just downloads the whole thing as-is. Faster, but less fancy.

**Q: Should I use preserve mode?**  
A: If you want maximum quality and don't care about file formats, yes. If you want everything in MP3 or M4A, no.

**Q: Why doesn't it work?**  
A: Did you install the dependencies? Did you read the instructions? Try that first.

**Q: I did that, why do I still get all sorts of errors?**  
A: Google changes stuff. Make sure you update yt-dlp to the latest version.

**Q: Can you add feature X?**  
A: Create an issue. We'll consider it if it's not terrible.

**Q: This is too complicated!**  
A: It's literally one command. Maybe stick to Spotify.

## Preserve Mode

If you want the original files, **without re-encoding**, and don't care about a consistent format, use `--preserve`  
This will still give you formatted files/folders. Original metadata is left intact, "Album Artist" and "RELEASETYPE" may be added, depending on the format.

**Run the command:**

```
$ ./youmad.sh --preserve
[2025-07-16 15:20:51] [INFO] Starting YouMAD?
[2025-07-16 15:20:51] [INFO] YouMAD? preserve format mode enabled - no re-encoding.

## Persistent + Playlist

Introducing the `--playlist` option will also bypass metadata cleanup.  
Combined with `--preserve`, your files will not be reencoded, metadata stays untouched, but there is still some effort to keep the files organized.

**Run the command:**

```
